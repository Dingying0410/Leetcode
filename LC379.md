Maintain a queue that has the available numbers, and maintain a set to store the numbers that have been used  
+ get: poll a number from the queue if it is not empty
+ check: check if the number is contained in the set
+ release: remove from the set, and push to the queue

One solution I had was that in **get** method, I did not use a queue, I loop through 0 to the maximum number, and then find a number that is available, this would take O(n), instead, we use a queue to do this in O(1)
