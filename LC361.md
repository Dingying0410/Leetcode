## [LC361 Bomb Enemy](LC361.java)
+ The idea is to record the number of enemies we can bomb on each row and each column, and store them in a variable/ array to prevent repeated computation  

+ On each row/ column, we need to recompute the number of enemies if we encounter a 'Wall', and we should count the number of enemies after the 'Wall' `eg. [["W"],["E"],["W"],["0"],["E"]]`
