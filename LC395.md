## [LC395  Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters](LC395.java)  
The idea is to not to process the substring that we have processed already.

For example, given aaabcc, if then aaa and cc are qualified, so we are going to use a invoke a recursive method on aaa, and then continue the for loop, set the loop to start at b.  
+ Start from j = 0, and then increment j until count(c) >= k, start from j, set k = j, increment k until count(c) < k, here j = 0, and k = 3, set the next for loop to start from 4, which means we will not process the substring we have preocessed before
+ maxLen = max(maxLen, function(s, j, k))
