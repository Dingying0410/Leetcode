# LC260 Single Number III  
### Ideas:
#### 1. Do XOR for all the numbers.
eg. [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
##### we get 4 xor 5 = 1, which means the two numbers differ in the first bit from the right
#### 2. Then we can divide the numbers into two groups, (1) the first group: the first bit is 0, (2) the second group: the first bit is 1, we do this using AND Operation, to do this, we have to get the last set bit, which is the last bit being 1
##### num &= -num --> last set bit
eg. 4 & 1 = 0, 5 & 1 = 1
#### 3. Do XOR after the division, then each group will contain the single number
eg. the first bit of 1, 3 are 1, and the first bit of 2 is 0
