## [LC 662 Maximum Width of Binary Tree](LC662.java)
+ we can use array to represent a binary tree, where the index of a root's child is 2 \* i + 1, and 2 \* i + 2  
+ we use start[level] and end[level] to represent the leftmost index and rightmost index for each level
+ width of each level = end[level] - start[level] + 1
