## [LC368 Largest Divisible Subset](LC368.java)
##### Idea:
+ Sort the array first, if a % b = 0, then a is divisible by all the numbers before b
+ dp[i]: the longest length of numbers divisible by nums[i]
+ last[i]: the last number divisible by nums[i]
+ Use maxLen to record the largest length, the largest dp[i]
+ Use index to record the corresponding index  
+ `Eg. [1, 3, 7, 21, 42, 49]`
+ `dp[4] = 5, last[4] = 3....`
