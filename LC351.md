## [LC 351. Android Unlock Patterns](LC351.java)
+ Backtracking
+ First we should know the skip number between each two numbers  
+ Then we choose the next number with the following two conditions:   
    1. skip number is 0  
    2. the skip number is not 0 but has been used

The number of patterns that can be created using **m** keys from **start**
```java
  public int helper (int start, int m, int[][] skip, boolean[] used) {
        if (m == 1)
            return 1;
        int total = 0;
        used[start] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            int jump = skip[start][i];
            if (!used[i] && (jump == 0 || (used[jump]))) {
                total += helper(i, m - 1, skip, used);
            }
        }
        used[start] = false;
        return total;
    }
```
