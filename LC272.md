## [LC 272 Closest Binary Search Tree Value II](LC272.java)
The idea is to  
(1) use two stacks, one decreasing, and one increasing to store the numbers that are
larger than the target and smaller than the target respectively
+  Decreasing stack: Traverse the right subtree first so that the larger values will be pushed into the stack first, so that the values that are closer to the target will be popped first
+ Increasing stack: Traverse the left subtree first so that the larger values will be pushed into the stack first, so that the values that are closer to the target will be popped first

(2) do a merge sort based on the two stacks, and add the values to the result list
