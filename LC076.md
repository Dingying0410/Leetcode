## [LC76 Minimum Window Substring](LC076.java)

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

+ Use a map, for every character in T, decrease the count by 1, and for every character in S, increase the count by 1

+ For each character in S, if the count is **less than 0**, then add count by 1
```
Why <=, but not ==, consider the case for S = "aa", and T = "aa" 
```

+ When we find a smaller substring window, update min, and the start
