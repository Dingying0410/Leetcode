## [LC373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums](LC373.java)
+ The general idea is to use a heap, and the elements of the heap is an array of length 3.
```  
nums[0]: sum of the numbers in the two arrays  
nums[1]: index in nums1  
nums[2]: index in nums2   
```
+ For each number in nums1, the smallest number in nums2 that can pair with it is nums2[0]  

+ After we pop an element in the heap, we need to push the next element to the heap, which can be inferred given the third filed of the array (the next corresponding element in nums2)

+ Also, we do not need to push all the numbers in nums1 to the heap, just push **min(k, nums1.length)** would be enough
