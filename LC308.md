### Binary indexed tree  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-indexed-tree-or-fenwick-tree-2/

#### Representation
Binary Indexed Tree is **represented as an array**. Let the array be BITree[]. Each node of Binary Indexed Tree stores sum of some elements of given array. Size of Binary Indexed Tree is equal to n where n is size of input array. In the below code, we have used size as **n+1** for ease of implementation.


#### Time complexity  
Update: O(log n)  
Get sum: O(log n)  

Compared to the previous solution, we can do update in O(n ^ 2), and get sum in O(1)  


#### Operations   
Get sum:
```
getSum(index): Returns sum of arr[0..index]
// Returns sum of arr[0..index] using BITree[0..n].  It assumes that
// BITree[] is constructed for given array arr[0..n-1]
1) Initialize sum as 0 and index as index+1.
2) Do following while index is greater than 0.
...a) Add BITree[index] to sum
...b) Go to parent of BITree[index].  Parent can be obtained by removing
     the last set bit from index, i.e., index = index - (index & (-index))
3) Return sum.
```

Update:
```
update(index, val): Updates BIT for operation arr[index] += val
// Note that arr[] is not changed here.  It changes
// only BI Tree for the already made change in arr[].
1) Initialize index as index+1.
2) Do following while index is smaller than or equal to n.
...a) Add value to BITree[index]
...b) Go to parent of BITree[index].  Parent can be obtained by removing
     the last set bit from index, i.e., index = index + (index & (-index))
```
