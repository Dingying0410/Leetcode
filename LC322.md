## [LC322 Coin Change](LC322.java)
#### Algorithm: Dynamic Programming
+ dp[i]: the minimum number of coins to get i  
+ initialization : dp[i] = amount + 1;
+ target: dp[amount], where amount is the value we want to get   
+ dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - coins[j]] + 1, dp[i]); 0 < j < coins.length

One problem I met was how to initialize dp[i],
+ if set to MAX_VALUE, then it will cause overflow when we plus by 1, eg. coins = [2], anount = 3
+ if set to i + 1, still the same problem
+ thus, we set it to amount + 1, and at last, if amount < dp[amount], return -1
