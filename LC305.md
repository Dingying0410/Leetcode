## [LC 305 Number of Islands II](LC305.java)  
Algorithm:
Union find  
For each new island added, we check if any islands are already formed in their four neighbors, by checking the root of their neighbors.

Union the island with the neighbors if they are in different island.

eg.
m = 3  
n = 3  
positions = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,2],[0,0],[1,1]]  

After [1, 0] is added:  

|id   | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| --- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| root|-1  |1   |-1  |3   |-1  |5   |-1  |7   | -1 |

islands = 4  

After [0, 2] is added:  

|id   | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| --- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| root|-1  |2   |-1  |2   |-1  |2   |-1  |7   | -1 |

islands = 3  

After [0, 0] is added:  

|id   | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| --- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| root|0   |0   |-1  |0   |-1  |2   |-1  |7   | -1 |

islands = 2  
......
